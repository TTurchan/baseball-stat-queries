# Baseball Statistics Natural Language Query Interface

ðŸš§ **Project Status: Under Active Development** ðŸš§

## Overview

This web application allows users to query baseball statistics using natural language. Instead of navigating complex database schemas or learning specific query syntax, users can simply ask questions in plain English, such as:

- "Show me the top 10 batting averages from the 2023 season"
- "Give me the batting statlines of the top 10 best single seasons by bWar for position players over the past 15 years"
- "Which pitchers had the highest strikeout rates in the National League last year?"

## How It Works

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Users input their questions through a clean, intuitive web interface
2. **Query Processing**: The application processes these natural language queries using a model context protocol
3. **Data Retrieval**: The system queries public baseball databases to fetch relevant statistics
4. **Results Display**: Data is presented in an interactive table format with sorting, filtering, and export capabilities
